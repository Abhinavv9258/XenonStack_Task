# Linux Custom Script Task

## Steps to run the script

<ul>
    <li> Step 1 : Clone this repository into your home directory in Linux. </li>
    <li> Step 2 : Now copy "internsctl" script file from "internsctl/usr/local/bin/" and paste it in home directory. </li>
    <li> Step 3 : Open terminal and run following commands -> "cd~" to move to root directory, "chmod +x internsctl" to make the script executable, "sudo mv internsctl /usr/local/bin/" to move the script file to "/usr/local/bin/" </li>
    <li> Step 4 : Now copy "internsctl.1" manual file from "internsctl/usr/share/man/man1/" and paste it in home directory. </li>
    <li> Step 5 : Open terminal and run following commands -> "sudo mv internsctl.1 /usr/share/man/man1/" to move the script file to "/usr/share/man/man1/" </li>
    <li> Step 5 : Now our setup is complete for custom linux commands, and we can now test our commands like "internsctl -h" to display help, "internsctl -v" to display the version information "man internsctl" to view the manual page,  etc.</li>
</ul>
